    "A very common unsupervised learning task is *dimensional reduction*; taking a dataset with a dimension of $d_h$ and reducing to a dimension of $d_l$ which is smaller than $d_h$ but retains as much of the useful information as possible. The most common application is for **visualisation**, because humans are best at interpreting 2D data and struggle with higher dimensions.\n",

This of course depends upon what the \"essential properties\" that we want to keep are, but generally we want to reject *noise* and keep non-random structure. We find a **subspace** that captures the meaningful variation of a dataset.\n",

    "One way of viewing this process is finding *latent variables*; variables we did not directly observe, but which are simple explanations of the ones we did observe. For example, if we measure a large number of weather measurements (rainfall, pressure, humidity, windspeed), these might be a very redundant representation of a few simple variables (e.g. is there a storm?). If features correlate or cluster in the measured data we can learn this structure *even without knowing training labels*."
