    "## Topic Purpose\n",
    "In this part, we will explore how **unsupervised learning** can pull out structure from **sensors**. We can use this \"natural\", latent structure to build interfaces without having to predefine our controls.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "* <a href=\"#motivation\"> Think about objective methods for designing UI controls </a>\n",
    "* <a href=\"#unsupervised\"> Discuss unsupervised learning </a>\n",
    "* <a href=\"#clustering\"> Explore clustering algorithms </a>\n",

    "### Motivation\n",
    "<a id=\"motivation\"></a>\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs/mainfold_labeled.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "For many conventional UI sensors, we already have good mappings from **sensor measurements** to **interface actions**. This is largely because the sensors were designed specifically to have electrical outputs which are very close to the intended actions; a traditional mechanical mouse literally emits electrical pulses at a rate proportional to translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "But with optical sensors like a Kinect, or with a high-degree of freedom flexible sensor, or tricky sensors like electromyography (which measures the electrical signals present as muscles contract), these mappings become tricky. Supervised learning lets train a system to recognise patterns in these signals (e.g. to classify poses or gestures). \n",
    "**But what if you don't know what's even feasible or would make a good interface?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inherent structures\n",
    "\n",
    "If we take sensor measurements of a person doing \"random stuff\" (see [Rewarding the Original](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~jhw/motionexplorerdata/) CHI 2012 for ideas on how to make \"random stuff\" a formal process!), we will will end up with a set of feature vectors that were both **performable** and **measurable** (because we know someone did them and a sensor measured them). *You will get a chance to apply the ‘Rewarding the Original’ approach tomorrow in the practicals associated with Rod’s lecture, so if you have time this evening, feel free to have a read of the paper, or watch the video in advance*\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to look at this data is to recover **inherent structure** in these measurements -- are there **regularities** or **stable points** which represent things which might be good controls?\n",

    "<a id=\"unsupervised\"></a>\n",
    "Unsupervised learning learns \"interesting things\" about the structure of data without any explicit labeling of points. The key idea is that datasets may have a simple underlying or *latent* representation which can be determined simply by looking at the data itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two common unsupervised learning tasks are *clustering* and *dimensional reduction*. Clustering can be thought of as the unsupervised analogue of classification -- finding discrete classes in data. Dimensional reduction can be thought of as the analogue of regression -- finding a small set of continuous variables which \"explain\" a higher dimensional set. "

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs/cluster_img.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many, *many* clustering approaches. A simple one is *k-means*, which finds clusters via an iterative algortihm. The number of clusters must be chosen in advance. In general, it is hard to estimate the number of clusters, although there are algorithms for estimating this. k-means proceeds by choosing a set of $k$ random points as initial cluster seed points; classifiying each data point according to its nearest seed point; then moving the cluster point towards the mean position of all the data points that belong to it. \n",
