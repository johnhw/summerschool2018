Add better Kalman example where evidence space != state space   
Add equations to make kf section clearer
Animate dynamics plots
emphasise model-basedness
better intro to probabilistic filtring
SOM live pinning example
write the pf equations accurately and in more detail
clean up horrible global variables in KF code
clean up git to reduce file size
