    "Unsupervised learning learns a model of interaction directly from **data**. The way in which user action is interpreted is determined empirically through a rigorous algorithmic process. This is both a **computational process** for capturing user behaviour systematically and mapping it on actions, and actionable computational models that can be applied to specific problems.\n",

This is largely because the sensors were designed specifically to have electrical outputs which are very close to the intended actions; a traditional mechanical mouse literally emits electrical pulses at a rate proportional to translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "But with optical sensors like a Kinect, or with a high-degree of freedom flexible sensor, or tricky sensors like electromyography (which measures the electrical signals present as muscles contract), these mappings become tricky. Supervised learning lets train a system to recognise patterns in these signals (e.g. to classify poses or gestures). \n",

    "#### Distance transform\n",
    "Sometimes it is useful to have some continuous elements in an otherwise discrete interface (e.g. to support animation on state-transitions). A useful trick is to use a **distance transform**, which takes a datapoint in the original measured space $D_H$ and returns the distances to all cluster centres. (`sklearn`'s `transform` function for certain clustering algorithms does this transformation for you)\n",
    "\n",
    "This could be used, for example, to find the top two candidates for a hand pose, and show a smooth transition between actions as the hand interpolates between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most obvious use of this is to **disable** any action when the distance to all clusters is too great. This implements a quiescent state and is part of solving the **Midas touch** problem; you only spend a small amount of time on a UI actively interacting and don't want to trigger actions all the time!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Manifolds\n",
    "\n",
    "In the continuous case, with a dimensional reduction approach, then the mapping can often be a simple transformation of the inferred manifold. This usually requires that the manifold be **oriented** correctly; for example, in the head pointing example, I adjusted the signs of the resulting 2D manifold to match the direction my nose points in. More generally, it might be necessary to apply a scaling or rotation of the output with a linear transform:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x_l = f(x_h)\\\\\n",
    "x_c = Ax_l,\n",
    "$$ where $x_l$ is the low-dimensional vector, $x_h$ is high dimensional sensor vector, $x_c$ is the vector (e.g. a cursor) we pass to the UI, and $A$ is a hand-tuned or learned transformation matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, $A = \\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 1\\end{bmatrix}$ exchanges the $x$ and $y$ co-ordinate and flips the sign of $y$.\n",

    "## Challenge\n",
    "<a id=\"challenge\"></a>\n",
    "In this practical, you will capture images from your webcam, and build a UI **control** using unlabeled data. Without providing **any** class labels or values, you have to build an interaction that can do \"something interesting\" from the image data. \n",
    "\n",
    "You have complete freedom to choose what the configuration space you want to use is; you could take images of your face or hands; take images of drawn figures; image an object rotating or moving across a surface; or anything else you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an illustrative example, the unsupervised approach could be used to image a soft drinks can at different rotations, and recover the rotation angle as an input (i.e. as a physical \"dial\").\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs/can.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The criterion is the most **interesting** but **functional** interface. The control can be discrete (using **clustering**) or continuous (using **manifold learning**). **You don't have to map the controls onto a real UI, just extract and visualise a useful signal from the image data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final system should be able to take a webcam image and output either a class or a (possibly $n$-dimensional) continuous value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "* The webcam capture code is provided for you. `cam = Webcam()` creates a camera object and `img = cam.snap()` captures a single image from the first video device; if you have several, then you can use `cam = Webcam(1)` etc. to select the device to use. The result will be a $W\\times H\\times 3$ NumPy array, with colours **in the BGR order**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You should resize your image (using `scipy.ndimage.zoom`) to something small (e.g. 32x48 or 64x64) so that the learning is feasible in the time available.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your \"interface\" should probably show a 2D or 1D layout of the data in the training set, and have a mode where a new webcam image can be captured and plotted on the layout. You should consider colouring the data points by their attributes (e.g. cluster label) and/or showing some small images on the plot to get an idea of what is going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can preprocess features as you like, but a good clustering/manifold learning algorithm will be able to capture much of the structure without this. **The simplicity of the processing applied will considered in judging!**; minimise the amount of hand-tweaking that you do.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Remember that some layout algorithms (e.g. t-SNE) are **unstable**. You may want to run the dimensional reduction several times and choose a good result, and use a repeatable random number seed (e.g. set it using `np.random.seed` or pass a custom `RandomState` to `sklearn`).\n"
